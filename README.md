## Personal Blog

On this static website, I plan to explore and archive some of my thoughts on a variety of topics that interest me.

> My name is Fritz Ali Agildere, I study physics with a special interest in astronomy and cosmology, but regularly
> get distracted by various other topics. On this blog, I plan to document my work, organize my thoughts and learn
> some basic webdesign in the process.
